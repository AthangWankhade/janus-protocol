# Note: We usually ignore android/ios folders in Expo unless we have custom native code.
# Since we are using 'npx expo prebuild', it's often better to ignore them and let prebuild generate them.
# However, if you have modified them manually, you might want to keep them.
# Given the user asked to exclude dependencies, I'll assume standard Expo managed workflow behavior where these are generated.
# But wait, the user modified app.json and ran prebuild.
# Let's stick to standard Expo ignore patterns which usually IGNORE android/ios if they are generated.
# But if the user ejected or is using CNG (Continuous Native Generation), they are ignored.
# I will add them to ignore for now as 'npx expo prebuild --clean' implies they are ephemeral.
